# Moisture_analysis
The program inside mositure_analysis.py contains three sections:
1. Plot precipitable water probability distribution
2. Plot precipitation probability distribution
3. Plot PW vs. TP relationship

The folder named test_data&figures contains ERA5 reanalysis and GEFS output as well as test figures. 
The test figures may look noisy because we only select 5 days for each year from 2000 to 2001 due to the maximum upload file size limit.
